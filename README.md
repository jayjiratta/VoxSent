# VoxSent
VoxSent is a Streamlit-based web application that converts speech into text and analyzes sentiment and emotions. The system is powered by a custom-trained NLP model for emotion and sentiment classification using:

GoEmotions Dataset (Google) – For emotion classification into 27 categories + Neutral
Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis Dataset – For sentiment classification (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
A pre-trained Speech-to-Text (STT) model is used to efficiently transcribe spoken input.
